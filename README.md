# BostonHacks

This is our 2017 Fall Boston Hackathon Project.

The goal of the project was to create a "fun & wacky" project that "puts humans at the center" in order to "help them live safer and more secure lives." It was also recommended that we "demonstrate the most attention to the user base," and bonus points for using the Shine API that Liberty Mutual provides.

Using the Liberty Mutual API, we wrote a webpage that would take as an input the address of the user and then return the relative safety score of that address.
